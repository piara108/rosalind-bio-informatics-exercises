# Counting DNA Nucleotides

## Problem
A string is simply an ordered collection of symbols selected from some alphabet and formed into a word; the length of a string is the number of symbols that it contains.

An example of a length 21 DNA string (whose alphabet contains the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T') is "ATGCTTCAGAAAGGTCTTACG."

Given: A DNA string, s, of length at most 1000 nt.

Return: Four integers (separated by spaces) counting the respective number of times that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in s.

## Data Set
```
AGCTTTTCATTCTGACTGCAACGGGCAATATGTCTCTGTGTGGATTAAAAAAAGAGTGTCTGATAGCAGC
```

## Sample Output
```
20 12 17 21
```

## Requirements

Install necessary dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Making the Test Suite Pass

Run the Test Suite using:

```bash
$ npm test
```

Delete the the x in `xtest` in order to run the test.
