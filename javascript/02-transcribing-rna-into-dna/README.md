# Transcribing RNA into DNA

## Problem
An RNA string is a string formed from the alphabet containing 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'U'.

Given a DNA string, *t*, corresponding to a coding strand, its transcribed RNA string, *u*, is formed by replacing all occurrences of 'T' in *t* with 'U' in *u*.

**Given:** A DNA string, *t*, having length at most 1000 nt.

**Return:** The transcribed RNA string of *t*.
